                p In a recent survey, fully 90 percent of insurers stated that they are actively engaged in some stage of digital transformation.  Some carriers have already entirely organized themselves around these tech-focused innovations while others are only just beginning the process.  Some insurers, borne of the digital age, were purpose-built to live on the web from their inception, while other long-established players are rapidly digitizing themselves to compete in this disrupted space.  Regardless of where in this process your organization currently finds itself, there are three central elements that a successful digital transformation requires:

Because cloud will bring major changes to the very way an organization conducts their business, stakeholders will not buy in right away without the right value proposition: use cases for cloud must drive clear economic and strategic value. Business, in a sense, is the first major roadblock to Cloud Organizational pushback and distrust can significantly delay and/or impede cloud adoption. For this reason, IT leaders must assess whether or not they have secured adequate time, resources, and sponsorship from stakeholders across the enterprise before starting cloud adoption

                p Cloud requires careful consideration of the technology landscape of the organization; reaping the full benefits of cloud requires planning, decision making, and setting up relevant policies, technologies, and tools. Therefore, it's crucial to evaluate your existing technology stack and infrastructure to decide which applications need to be re-architected for cloud, how will they be migrated, and what platforms and tools are necessary to support that migration. Knowing this will allow insurers to create a technology roadmap that takes advantage of the existing technology stack, while also accounting for the priorities and business goals.
